### Questions
- [x] What kind of role does integers play in program exit/termination ?
- [] What does happen with values which is being replaced in array with aother values just via subscript operator ?
- [x] Get comfortable with pointer arithmetics, especially with pointers difference.
- [] What is the name of DS against which keywords are being compared ?
- [] Why doesn't ALLOCATE macro worked for Entry allocation ?
- [] How does  CPU cache works ?
- [] what is Valgrind ?

### To Do
- [] memory.c   : exit when pointer is not null.
- [] vm.c       : display `empty stack` error.
- [] vm.c       : display `stack overflow` error.
- [] compiler.c : display `constants table overflow` error.
- [] scanner.c  : display `unknown token` error.
- [] scanner.c  : deal with other tokens too.
- [] debug.c    : implement other tokens debugging too.
- [] compiler.c : display `EOF or some kind of error` error
- [] compiler.c : display `prefix function dosn't exists` error
- [] compiler.c : think this part through.
- [] table.h    : introduce StrObj which will store key and hash.
- [x] table.c    : handle tombstones.
- [] table.c    : create function in memory.h to handle allocation in one place
- [] compiler.c : compute hash.
